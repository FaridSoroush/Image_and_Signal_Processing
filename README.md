# Signal and Image Processing Examples

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks that provide practical insights into fundamental concepts in signal and image processing. The notebooks are designed to offer hands-on examples with Python code, making it easier to understand and apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Contents

1. **signal_processing.ipynb**
   - This notebook covers the basics of signal processing, with a focus on signal conditioning and sensor calibration. It includes Python code for simulating signal conditioning for a temperature sensor and a basic sensor calibration using known reference values.

2. **image_processing.ipynb**
   - This notebook delves into image processing techniques. It includes examples of applying Fourier Transforms to images and implementing various edge detection methods such as Sobel, Canny, and Laplacian filters.
